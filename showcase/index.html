              <p>The harbor of Portus Sanguinis breathes with the rhythm of Mare Nostrum. Salt-crusted ropes creak against weathered wood. The smell of fish, tar, and foreign spices mingles with something older—something that clings to the man walking down the gangplank.</p>
              <p><strong class="highlight">Marcus Varro died three months ago.</strong> An arrow through the throat in Parthia, far from the sea he never knew he'd miss. He remembers the dark river. The ferryman's pale hand reaching for payment. And then—</p>
              <p>He woke on a beach with sand in his wounds and a cold coin clutched in his fist.</p>

              <p>Behind the bar, a one-armed man polishes a cup with the practiced efficiency of someone who's done it ten thousand times. His remaining arm bears the faded brand of <strong class="highlight">Legio XII Fulminata</strong>—the Thunderbolt Legion.</p>

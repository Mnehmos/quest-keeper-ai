          <p><strong>Excellent choice. Let's build something worth playing.</strong></p>
          <h4>Part 1: The World</h4>
          <p>First, let's establish the setting. A few questions:</p>
          <p><strong>Tone & Genre</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Classic High Fantasy - Heroes, dungeons, dragons, clear good vs evil</li>
            <li>Dark Fantasy - Gritty, morally gray, danger around every corner</li>
            <li>Weird Fantasy - Strange magic, alien influences, things that don't quite make sense</li>
            <li>Low Magic - Rare and mysterious, swords matter more than spells</li>
            <li>Mythic - Gods walk the earth, you're caught in divine machinations</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Scale</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Local - A single region, town politics, nearby dungeon</li>
            <li>Continental - Kingdoms at war, epic journeys, world-shaping events</li>
            <li>Planar - Reality-hopping, otherworldly threats</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Starting Location Vibe</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Frontier town at the edge of civilization</li>
            <li>Bustling trade city full of factions</li>
            <li>Ancient ruins everyone's afraid to enter</li>
            <li>A ship at sea heading somewhere dangerous</li>
            <li>Underground settlement in the deep dark</li>
            <li>Something else you have in mind?</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Give me your preferences on any or all of these, or just describe the world you want to explore in your own words. I'll generate it and we can refine from there.</p>

          <p>The Province of Aurelium lies at the edge of the Eternal Republic - a coastal region where old gods still speak through oracles, where legions march alongside divine champions, and where the boundary between mortal and immortal is dangerously thin.</p>
          <p>You've just arrived at <strong>Portus Sanguinis</strong> - the Port of Blood - named for the red clay cliffs that frame its harbor. Once a thriving naval hub, the port has fallen on strange times:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The Temple of Neptunus has gone silent. No prophecies in three months.</li>
            <li>Fishermen whisper of lights beneath the waves and nets that come up wrong</li>
            <li>The local Praefectus has tripled the harbor watch but won't say why</li>
            <li>A Legio detachment arrived two weeks ago - veterans, not recruits - and they're nervous</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The ship that carried you creaks against the dock. Gulls scream. Somewhere in the city, temple bells ring the hour.</p>
          <h4>Part 2: Your Character</h4>
          <p>Now - who steps off that gangplank?</p>
          <p><strong>The Basics</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Name (Latin-flavored or not, your call)</li>
            <li>Race (Human is default for Roman aesthetic, but I can make elves/dwarves/etc fit as foreign peoples or mythic bloodlines)</li>
            <li>Class - What's your role? Soldier, priest, scholar, thief, gladiator, wandering mystic?</li>
            <li>Background - Why are you here? Running from something? Seeking something? Ordered here?</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Tell me as much or as little as you want. I'll fill in the gaps.</p>

          <h4>The Story</h4>
          <p>You were a Centurion of the Legio IX Ferrata - the Iron Legion. Three months ago, during a skirmish against barbarian raiders in the northern mountains, an arrow found the gap in your armor. You remember falling. You remember the cold.</p>
          <p>Then you remember the river.</p>
          <p>A dark shore. A figure in a boat. You gave him the coin your mother placed on your tongue before your first campaign. He looked at it. Looked at you. And gave it back.</p>
          <p><em>"Not yet," he said. "You still owe."</em></p>
          <p>You woke in a burial pit with seventeen other legionnaires. You were the only one breathing.</p>
          <p>The Legion doesn't know what to do with you. Command gave you "indefinite leave" and a look that said <em>don't come back</em>. So you booked passage on the first ship heading anywhere else.</p>
          <p>It brought you here. To Portus Sanguinis. Where the gods have gone quiet.</p>
          <h4>Equipment</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Gladius of the Returned</strong> - The sword you died holding</li>
            <li><strong>Lorica Segmentata</strong> - Legion armor, dented over the heart</li>
            <li><strong>Coin for the Ferryman</strong> - Already spent. Somehow returned.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Abilities</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Death's Witness</strong> - You can see spirits of the recently dead, and sense when death is near</li>
            <li><strong>Unliving Debt</strong> - You don't know what the ferryman wants. But you know you owe.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>The Scene</h4>
          <p>The gangplank hits the dock with a hollow thud.</p>
          <p>Portus Sanguinis sprawls before you - terracotta roofs and white limestone climbing the red cliffs. The harbor is busy but <em>wrong</em> - too many soldiers, too few fishing boats. A trireme with black sails sits at anchor, flying no standard you recognize.</p>
          <p>The air tastes of salt, fish, and something else. Something like a temple after sacrifice.</p>
          <p>A dock worker glances at you, sees the armor, and looks away fast.</p>
          <p>To your left: The harbor district - taverns, warehouses, the smell of commerce.</p>
          <p>To your right: The cliff stairs - leading up to the temple district. The bells have stopped.</p>
          <p>Straight ahead: The legion camp - tents and standards on the beach. They're burning something.</p>
          <p><strong>What do you do?</strong></p>

          <h3>The Drowned Wolf</h3>
          <p>You follow the smell of grilled meat and cheap wine down a cobbled lane slick with fish guts. The harbor district is alive with commerce - spice merchants arguing prices, slaves hauling amphorae, a fortune teller reading entrails in an alley - but your eye catches the painted sign of a wolf sinking beneath blue waves.</p>
          <p>The tavern is built from the bones of a warship, its hull split open and roofed with sailcloth. The old mast still stands in the center, strung with oil lamps and dried fish like some kind of pagan offering. It's dim inside. It smells like smoke, sweat, and the sea.</p>
          <p>Heads turn when you enter. Legion armor draws eyes everywhere - some curious, some hostile, some calculating. Then they go back to their drinks.</p>
          <p>A one-armed man works the cooking pit, turning octopus skewers with practiced ease. Old legion tattoo on his remaining forearm - Legio XII Fulminata. The Thunderbolt Legion. He sees you see it, and nods once. Professional recognition.</p>
          <p><em>"Posca's a copper. Wine's three. Meat's two. Trouble's free but you pay for damages."</em></p>
          <p>You find a spot at a splintered table and take stock of the room:</p>
          <h4>THE OPPORTUNITIES</h4>
          <p><strong>[A]</strong> At the bar, a woman in a captain's coat is arguing with a nervous little man. She's got the look of money - good boots, silver rings - but her shoulders are tight. The little man keeps shaking his head. She needs something he won't give her.</p>
          <p><strong>[B]</strong> In the corner, a mountain of a woman arm-wrestles dock workers for coins. She's winning. Easily. A board behind her has parchments pinned to it - job postings, by the look of them.</p>
          <p><strong>[C]</strong> The one-armed tavern keeper is watching you with the eyes of a man who's done his twenty years and seen everything. Veterans talk to veterans.</p>
          <p><strong>[D]</strong> A thin man in a threadbare toga sits alone, cup untouched, eyes on the door. When he catches you looking, he flinches - then very deliberately glances toward the captain at the bar, then back to you.</p>
          <p><strong>What's your approach?</strong></p>

          <p>You loosen the leather thong and upend the pouch into your palm.</p>
          <p><strong>Three silver denarii. Twelve copper asses.</strong> And the other coin - the bronze one with the worn face - which you quickly slip back into the pouch before anyone sees it.</p>
          <p>Ship passage ate most of your severance pay.</p>
          <p>Three silvers. That's maybe a week at a cheap inn if you don't eat much. A few days if you do. Not enough to be comfortable. Enough to be desperate soon.</p>
          <p>The smell of grilled octopus twists your stomach. When's the last time you ate? The ship served hardtack and opinions.</p>

            <li>A room for the night: 8 copper (if Gnaeus has one)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>You can afford to eat and drink today. But you need work - and soon.</p>
          <p>The mountain woman in the corner just pinned another docker's arm to the table. Coins change hands. The job board behind her flutters in the sea breeze coming through the hull-gaps.</p>
          <p><strong>The math is simple: eat first, or work first?</strong></p>

          <p>You catch the one-armed man's eye and hold up fingers. He nods.</p>
          <p>A few minutes later, a clay cup of posca lands in front of you - sour wine cut with water and herbs, the taste of every legion camp you've ever known - and a wooden plate with two skewers of charred octopus, glistening with oil and sea salt.</p>
          <p>You eat. Gods, you eat.</p>
          <p>The octopus is chewy and smoky and perfect. The posca burns familiar down your throat. For a moment you're not a dead man walking - you're just a soldier at the end of a long march, filling his belly. Simple. Good.</p>
          <p>Gnaeus One-Arm comes to collect the plate. You ask about a room.</p>
          <p><em>"Got a hammock in the back. Roof don't leak much. Eight coppers, you're out by dawn."</em></p>
          <p>You pay. He bites the coins out of habit, then jerks his head toward a curtained doorway.</p>
          <p><em>"Stow your kit whenever. I don't touch other men's gear."</em></p>

          <p>You push back from the table, roll your shoulders, and walk toward the corner where the mountain woman is collecting her winnings.</p>
          <p>She sees you coming. A grin splits her sun-dark face.</p>
          <p><em>"Legionnaire wants to play?"</em> Her voice is like gravel in a bucket. <em>"Petra breaks arms for free. Costs money to try."</em></p>
          <p>The dockers around her laugh. One of them - a man with a crushed nose - shakes his head at you. Warning or pity, hard to say.</p>
          <p><em>"What's the buy-in?"</em> you ask.</p>
          <p><em>"Match what you bet. You win, double. You lose—"</em> She flexes a forearm like a ship's timber. <em>"—you lose."</em></p>
          <p>You drop your three silver and the lone copper on the table.</p>
          <p>Petra looks at the coins. Looks at you. Something flickers in her eyes - respect, maybe, for a man betting everything.</p>
          <p><em>"Huh."</em> She matches it from her pouch. <em>"Sit."</em></p>

          <p>A docker counts. <em>"One—two—THREE."</em></p>
          <p>You throw everything into it. Three months of rage and confusion and death, channeled into your arm, your shoulder, the leg braced against the floor—</p>
          <p><strong>Petra doesn't move.</strong></p>
          <p>She's not straining. She's not even leaning. She's just... there. Immovable. A cliff face in human form.</p>
          <p>Her eyes meet yours. Not mocking. Almost... curious.</p>
          <p><em>"You're strong,"</em> she says, conversationally, while your arm trembles and sweat beads on your forehead. <em>"Stronger than you look. But you're fighting yourself, legionnaire. I can feel it."</em></p>
          <p>And then she pushes.</p>
          <p>Your arm goes down. Not fast - she lowers it almost gently, like closing a door. But it goes down, and the dockers cheer, and your last three silver vanish into her massive fist.</p>

          <p>You sit back. Broke. The dockers are already losing interest, looking for the next challenger.</p>
          <p>But Petra hasn't looked away from you.</p>
          <p><em>"You've got the grip of a man who's held a sword too long,"</em> she says slowly. <em>"And the eyes of a man who's seen the River."</em></p>
          <p>She taps the job board behind her.</p>
          <p><em>"I run the docks. I know who needs what."</em> She leans forward. <em>"I also know that Captain Cassia over there has been looking for a man with exactly your qualifications for three days now. Offering good money. Nobody'll take the job."</em></p>
          <p>She pauses.</p>
          <p><em>"Ask her why."</em></p>
          <p>Petra jerks her thumb toward the woman in the captain's coat - the one arguing with the nervous man at the bar. The argument seems to have ended. Cassia is staring into her wine like it holds answers.</p>
          <p>You're broke, fed, and have a lead. The night is young.</p>

          <p>Captain Cassia Nereia doesn't look up when you approach. She's turning a silver ring on her finger — round and round, a nervous habit worn into muscle. The wine in front of her is untouched. The nervous little man has made himself scarce.</p>

          <h4>CASSIA'S STORY</h4>
          <p><strong>Captain Cassia Nereia.</strong> She runs the Fortuna's Spite — trade galley, forty oars, regular route between Portus Sanguinis and the island colonies. Good reputation. Never lost a cargo.p
          <p><em>"Until three weeks ago."</em></p>
          <p>She signals Gnaeus for posca. Drinks deep. Continues.</p>
          <p><em>"The job is this: The Insula Tacita. The Silent Isle. Fifteen leagues south. Uninhabited — officially — except for a temple complex that's been abandoned since my grandmother's time. Someone with more money than sense contracted me to deliver a chest to the old quay there. Paid in advance. Full fee. Very specific instructions: leave the chest at the temple doors. Don't open it. Don't look inside. Don't wait for acknowledgment. Just leave it and go."</em></p>
          <p>She pulls out a rolled parchment — a shipping manifest — and slides it across the bar.</p>
          <p><em>"Three weeks ago, I sent a boat with six men and the chest. Good sailors. Armed. They rowed into the mist and..."</em></p>
          <p>She trails off. Drinks again.</p>
          <p><em>"...and the boat came back. Empty. Oars still in the locks. No men. No chest."</em></p>
          <p>The tavern noise seems to fade around you.</p>
          <p><em>"The client won't answer my messages. The Harbor Guild is starting to ask questions. And I'm down six crew who had families."</em></p>
          <p>She looks at you directly.</p>
          <p><em>"I need someone to go ashore on that island and find out what happened. Find the chest — or proof of what happened to it. Find my men — or evidence of their fate. That's the job."</em></p>

          <p><em>"Half now, half when you're back on my deck with answers."</em></p>
          <p>She must see something in your expression, because she adds:</p>
          <p><em>"It's good money because nobody else will take it. The fishermen won't even sail south of the reef anymore. They say the Silent Isle is waking up."</em> She shrugs. <em>"Sailors are superstitious. But I've lost six men, and I don't believe in coincidences."</em></p>
          <p>She holds out her hand — the one with the silver ring.</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Cavalry Scutum</strong> — A round shield, good condition, fits the arm well (+2 AC when wielded)</li>
            <li><strong>Javelins (x3)</strong> — Standard issue</li>
            <li><strong>Hemp Rope (50 ft)</strong> — Well-oiled, no fraying</li>

          <p>Great question - let me actually check how the system handles this...</p>
          <p><strong>Short answer: No, it doesn't. And that's a problem.</strong></p>
          <p>Looking at the code, I can see that:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>The <code>equip_item</code> tool exists and correctly marks items as equipped</li>
            <li>Your shield IS equipped in the database</li>
            <li>But the character's AC is still showing 16 (base) instead of 18 (base + shield)</li>
          </ol>
          <p>This is a <strong>feature gap</strong> - the system doesn't automatically recalculate derived stats (like AC) when equipment changes. We'd need to either:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A) Add "derived stat calculation" to the equip/unequip logic</li>
            <li>B) Just manually update your AC with an <code>update_character</code> call</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>For now:</strong> Want me to fix Option A (so equipment auto-updates AC going forward), or just do Option B (quick fix for your current character)?</p>

          <h3>THE VOYAGE</h3>
          <p>The Fortuna's Spite cuts through grey water under a sky the color of bruises.</p>
          <p>Cassia runs a disciplined ship. The oarsmen work in shifts, a rhythmic drumbeat marking time. No one talks more than necessary. Even the gulls seem reluctant to follow.</p>
          <p>Four hours out from Portus Sanguinis, the water changes. It goes from grey-green to something darker. Oilier. The waves move against the wind.</p>
          <p>And then the mist appears.</p>
          <p>A bank of grey fog, sitting on the water like a wall. It shouldn't be there — not on a clear day, not this far from land. But there it is, stretching from horizon to horizon.</p>
          <p>The crew's rhythm falters. Someone murmurs a prayer to Neptunus.</p>
          <p>Cassia stands at the prow, staring into the grey. Her hand is on the rail, knuckles white.</p>
          <p><em>"Every time I send men into that..."</em> She trails off. Then: <em>"Last chance, legionnaire. Keep the advance. I'll turn the ship around. No hard feelings."</em></p>
          <p>The oarsmen have stopped rowing. All eyes are on you.</p>
          <p>You stand. Loosen your gladius in its sheath. Walk to the rail.</p>
          <p><em>"I've crossed one river already. Fog doesn't frighten me."</em></p>
          <p>Cassia nods once. <em>"Ahead, then. Full oars. Get us through quick."</em></p>
          <p>The drums resume. The Fortuna lurches forward. And the mist swallows you whole.</p>

          <p>Time... slips.</p>
          <p>The fog is thick — impossible to see more than ten feet. The oars splash into water that makes no sound. Someone is counting strokes, but the numbers don't match up. Twenty. Forty. A hundred. It feels like hours. It feels like minutes.</p>
          <p>And then, without warning: <strong>stone.</strong></p>
          <p>A quay emerges from the mist like a bad dream. Ancient masonry, green with age, slick with something that isn't quite seaweed. Stairs carved into black rock climbing up into... nothing. The rest of the island is invisible.</p>
          <p>But the rowboat is there.</p>
          <p>Still tied to the quay. Oars in the locks. <strong>Empty.</strong></p>
          <p>Cassia's jaw tightens. <em>"That's my boat,"</em> she says quietly. <em>"That's — those are Drusus's oars. He carved his initials."</em></p>
          <p>The crew won't look at the quay. Won't look at you.</p>
          <p><em>"We'll hold position as long as we can,"</em> Cassia says. <em>"But if that mist moves — if anything comes out of it — we're gone. You understand?"</em></p>
          <p>You understand.</p>
          <p>You climb down to the stone quay. The Fortuna's Spite is already pulling back, oars churning, vanishing into the grey.</p>
          <p><strong>You are alone on the Silent Isle.</strong></p>

          <p>You climb with the discipline of a decade of training. Blade ready. Shield up. Each step tested before weight commits. The mist clings to you like wet wool.</p>
          <p>At the quay's edge, arranged in a neat line: <strong>six packs.</strong> Sailor's kits — rope, waterskins, rations. Set down carefully. Deliberately. The men removed their gear, placed it here, and walked on without it.</p>
          <p>You don't touch the packs. You climb.</p>
          <p>Fifty steps. A hundred. The fog thins. Light changes — not brighter, but different. Older, somehow.</p>

          <h3>THE TEMPLE OF THE DREAMING DEEP</h3>
          <p>A ring of pillars — twelve of them — each carved from black stone that doesn't match anything on this island. Older than Roman. Older than Greek. Script writhes on their surfaces in patterns that hurt to follow.</p>
          <p>At the center of the ring: <strong>a pool.</strong></p>
          <p>Black water. Perfectly still. Not reflecting the sky — there is no sky here, only mist — but somehow darker than it should be. It looks... deep. Impossibly deep. As if the pool goes down forever.</p>
          <p>And kneeling at the water's edge: <strong>six figures.</strong></p>
          <p>Sailors. Cassia's men. Eyes open. Not blinking. Not breathing. Bodies here, but minds... somewhere else. Their faces are slack, peaceful. One of them is smiling.</p>
          <p>Beyond the pool, on a stone altar: <strong>the chest.</strong> Bronze, green with age. Symbols on its surface that squirm when you try to focus on them.</p>
          <p>The mission objective. Right there.</p>
          <p>But the pool is between you and it. And something in the water is watching.</p>

          <p>You don't reach for the chain. You don't have to.</p>
          <p>The ferryman's coin blazes in your pouch — white-hot, burning through cloth and leather. You pull it out, and in this place of dreams and darkness, it gleams like a star.</p>
          <p>The presence watches. The chains watch.</p>
          <p><em>"I know what it is to be bound between worlds,"</em> you say. Not aloud — there's no air here for words. But the meaning carries. <em>"I know what it is to owe a debt you never chose."</em></p>
          <p>You press the coin to the nearest chain.</p>
          <p>The metal screams. Bronze — ancient, divine, impossible — <em>cracks.</em> The sound is like the world breaking. The chain falls away into the dark, link by link, dissolving into nothing.</p>
          <p><strong>The presence moves.</strong></p>
          <p>Not free — not yet — but <em>freer</em>. One binding gone. Others still hold. But the geometry of the thing shifts, unfolds, and for a moment you see something vast and incomprehensible reaching toward light it hasn't touched in millennia.</p>
          <p><strong><em>&lt; ...THANK YOU. &gt;</em></strong></p>

          <h3>EMERGENCE</h3>
          <p>You break the surface gasping.</p>
          <p>The pool is churning — black water gone white with foam. Around the edge, the six dreamers are stirring, coughing, coming back to themselves.</p>
          <p>The chest on the altar <em>shatters</em>. Bronze fragments fly outward, and the symbols carved on them <em>scream</em> as they die — a sound like a thousand voices crying out and then falling silent.</p>
          <p>The mist is lifting. Sunlight — actual sunlight — breaks through the grey for the first time.</p>
          <p>And somewhere, far below, something ancient shifts and begins to wake.</p>

          <p>One of the sailors — the one with the carved oars — looks at you with eyes that are only now remembering how to see. His voice is a croak:</p>
          <p><em>"What... what did you do?"</em></p>
          <p>You haul him to his feet. <em>"I made a choice. Can you walk?"</em></p>
          <p>He can walk. They all can. Dazed, confused, but alive.</p>
          <p>You lead them down the stairs. The Fortuna's Spite is still there — Cassia refused to leave. Her face when she sees the crew is... complicated.</p>
          <p><em>"You found them,"</em> she says. <em>"You actually — and the chest?"</em></p>
          <p><em>"Destroyed."</em></p>
          <p>A long pause. She looks at you. Really looks.</p>
          <p><em>"I'm not going to ask. But you're going to tell me eventually."</em></p>
          <p>The oars stroke the water. The mist parts. Home.</p>

          <p>You circle the building. Find a gap in the planks. Look inside.</p>
          <p><strong>Magistrate Corvus.</strong> You recognize him from the docks — a temple official, supposedly above suspicion. He's meeting with Titus and two temple guards in plain clothes.</p>

          <p>From the depths — from somewhere impossibly far below — a presence rises. Not surfacing. Just... becoming aware.</p>
          <p><strong><em>&lt; I REMEMBER YOU, LITTLE REVENANT. &gt;</em></strong></p>
          <p>The darkness ripples. The chains you broke — you can almost hear them, somewhere in the deep, still falling.</p>
          <p><strong><em>&lt; I REMEMBER MERCY. &gt;</em></strong></p>
          <p>Cassia gasps. The translucence of her spirit is solidifying. The edges are coming back.</p>
          <p><strong><em>&lt; SHE STILL OWES. AS YOU STILL OWE. BUT THE CROSSING CAN WAIT. &gt;</em></strong></p>
          <p>The ferryman's boat turns. Rows away. The dark river folds in on itself.</p>
          <p><strong><em>&lt; REMEMBER THIS DEBT. BOTH OF YOU. WHEN I CALL, YOU WILL ANSWER. &gt;</em></strong></p>
          <p>And then—</p>

          <h3>EMERGENCE</h3>
          <p>Your eyes snap open. You're kneeling on the warehouse floor. Corvus is cowering. Titus is whimpering. The guards are dead.</p>
          <p>And Cassia—</p>
          <p><strong>Cassia is breathing.</strong></p>
          <p>A ragged, gasping, <em>impossible</em> breath. Her eyes fly open — wild, panicked, <em>alive</em>. She sits up, clawing at her chest, at the wound that isn't there anymore. Just smooth skin under torn cloth, with a faint mark like water rippling outward from where the blade went in.</p>
          <p>She stares at you. At her bloodsoaked shirt. At the dead guards.</p>
          <p><em>"Marcus."</em> Her voice is shaking. <em>"<strong>What the fuck did you just do?</strong>"</em></p>
          <p>You help her to her feet. She's unsteady — alive, but barely. The ferryman's coin is gone from your pouch. Spent for real this time.</p>
          <p><em>"I called in a favor,"</em> you say. <em>"You're welcome."</em></p>
          <p>She looks at Corvus. At Titus. At the evidence of conspiracy in this warehouse.</p>
          <p><em>"We need to get out of here. The temple guards—"</em></p>
          <p>"Already coming, I imagine. Corvus?"</p>
          <p>The magistrate glares at you with pure hatred. But he's beaten. He knows it.</p>

          <p>You pull a copper coin from your pouch. Flip it. Catch it. Slap it on the back of your hand.</p>
          <p>Tails.</p>
          <p>Titus sees it. Understands. <em>"Wait — please — I was just following orders, I didn't—"</em></p>
          <p>The gladius moves once. Clean. Fast. The way the Legion taught you.</p>
          <p>Cassia watches. Says nothing. She's seen soldiers execute traitors before.</p>
          <p><em>"And him?"</em> She jerks her chin at Corvus.</p>
          <p>"He's a magistrate. He has information. The conspiracy doesn't end with these three."</p>
          <p>You haul Corvus to his feet. Bind his hands with the rope from your pack.</p>
          <p><em>"We take him to the Praefectus. Let the law sort him out."</em></p>
          <p>Cassia nods. Touches her chest again — the mark that wasn't there before.</p>
          <p><em>"Marcus. What you did — what happened to me — I felt the river. I saw the boat."</em></p>
          <p>"I know."</p>
          <p><em>"I owe you my life."</em></p>
          <p>"You owe something. But not to me."</p>
          <p>She goes quiet. Thinking.</p>
          <p>You lead the way out of the warehouse. The night air is cold and clear. The temple bells have stopped. Somewhere in the distance, you can hear shouting — the city waking up to the fact that something has changed.</p>
          <p>Behind you, under the sea, in the deep dark places, something ancient stirs and dreams of freedom.</p>
